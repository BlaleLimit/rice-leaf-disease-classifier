This folder contains the old versions of the recognition system.


1. ML-Rice_Disease_Recognition - Initial Model built, includes 3 models to be used (1-layered, 2-layered, and AlexNet CNN models)
2. cnn_based_recognition_system_v1 - cleaned up code. Only AlexNet was retained as the model for rice leaf disease recognition
3. cnn_based_recognition_system_v2 - changed dataset to be used. From dataset with 4 classifications to dataset with 3 classifications
4. cnn_based_recognition_system_v3 - added statistical methods to measure performance of model.
5. cnn_based_recognition_system_v4 - added confusion matrix for easier visualization of the correct classifications per predicted class
6. cnn_based_recognition_system_v5 - added visualization parts, training_test_split (for data splitting of a single compiled dataset), and other sections
7. cnn_based_recognition_system_v6 - added k-fold cross validation section, to obtain the average accuracy of the model, and also added difference in performance of the two models (with and without Visual Attention).
8. cnn_based_recognition_system_v7 - current version, solved naming error in k-fold cross validation section,
